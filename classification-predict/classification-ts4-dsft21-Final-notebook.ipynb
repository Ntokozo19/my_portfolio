Introduction\n**EDSA - Climate Change Belief Analysis 2021**\n\nMany companies are built around lessening oneâ€™s environmental impact or carbon footprint. They offer products and services that are environmentally friendly and sustainable, in line with their values and ideals. They would like to determine how people perceive climate change and whether or not they believe it is a real threat. This would add to their market research efforts in gauging how their product/service may be received.\n\nWith this in mind, we will create a Machine Learning model that is able to classify whether or not a person believes in climate change, based on their historical tweet data.\n\n\n## Comet\n\nComet is a great tool for version control as it records the parameters,experiments and conditions from each of the experiements- allowing for reproducing of results, or going back to a previous version of the experiment.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img src=\"https://d2dfxqxblmblx4.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/18151729/twitter-logo.png\">","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"data\"></a>\n# 2.

This hashtag comes from the documentary named Before the flood where the famous actor Leonardo DiCaprio meets with scientists, activists and world leaders to discuss the dangers of climate change and possible solutions. This documentary created a lot of awareness and education around climate change and the causes of it. It brought, to everyday people's TV screens, the truth about climate change and the true impact it has and will continue to have on the planet if we dont change our way of living. Since this show, many people have jumped on the pro climate change band wagon and have started speaking out, which is what we are seeing with this hashtag.\n\n\n* Another famous hashtag in the pro climate change hashtags is the #ImVotingBecause. As Americans select their next president, voters share their thoughts as to why they have chosen their candidate with the hashtag #ImVotingBecause. The social media landscape shows that supporters are firm in their convictions and consider this election a historic one. This hashtag also falls under climate change issues because in America climate change has become one of the most important issues in politics and climate change supporters want to vote for a president who views climate change as a priority. Donald Trump was also a president who reversed a lot of work done by climate change advocates around the world.\n\n\n* Another hashtag that was in the top 5 was the #COP22 which is The 2016 United Nations Climate Change Conference that was an international meeting of political leaders and activists to discuss environmental issues. It was held in Marrakech, Morocco, on 7â€“18 November 2016. This is where the Trump administration formerly announced their plans to exit the climate change deal. Climate change supporters where not happy with this decision. This also exlains the #Trump which also appears at number 9 of the pro climate change hashshtags.\n\n\n_**Anti climate change hashtags:**_\n\n* The number hastag used by anti climate changers is #MAGA. \"Make America Great Again\" or MAGA is a campaign slogan used in American politics popularized by Donald Trump in his successful 2016 presidential campaign. During his presidency Donald trump did not shy away from expressing his anti climate change views and his supporters didnt either. That is why #Trump is also the 3rd most frequently used hashtag in the anti climate change hashtags.\n\n\n* Hashtags such as #Fakenews, #climatescam, #DrainTheSwamp also made it to the top hashtags and they are all related to anti climate chmage supporters who believe thet climate change is a lie or a scam which is also perpurtuated by Donald Trump. So we can see from all these hashtags that Donald Trump is the biggest leader who is anti climate change and who's supporters are also anti climate change.\n\n\n* TCOT which stands for Top Conservative On Twitter takes the number 8 spot. The term provides a way for conservatives in particular and Republicans in general to locate and follow the tweets of like-minded individuals. We're sensing a pattern here: Trump, top conservatives on twitter, make America great again, Drain the swamp\n\n\n\n_**Neutral climate change hashtags:**_\n\n* In the neutral category, a few of the top hashtags were not directly related to climate change eg. Hashtags like GlobalWarming, AmReading, budget and QandA could suggest that these tweets are made by people who are still undecided on the topic but could be open to discussions and are interested in finding new/more information.\n\n* In general neutral climate change tweets have hashtags that are not as polarized as the anti and pro hashtags.\n\n* America and China are responsible for 40% of the world's carbon emissions and are the most mentioned geopolitical entities in pro climate change tweets, most likely for this reason\n\n\n\n\n_**News climate change hashtags:**_\n\n* The hashtags in the news category are less emotive and aim to bring awareness to high profile topics related to climate change that are or were trending in the news. Examples of such hashtags include News and Science which would be used to indicate that the tweet contains information from a news outlet or a scientific study.\n\n* ParisAgreement, COP22 and Trump are popular hashtags. Trump made headlines when he pulled out of the climate agreement, so it makes sense that these hashtags would be trending in climate change news.\n\n* ClimateMarch - many protests have been held, some even global, to raise awareness about climate change. These protests usually make headlines and are featured on news sites\n\nA natural next step to take is to look at what other words are used in the tweets for each that can give us an indication of the sentiment. We will build word clouds to visualize these.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.4.1 Frequent words Analysis in each sentiment","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Plotting word clouds\nnews = df_all[df_all['sentiment'] == 'News']['message']\npro = df_all[df_all['sentiment'] == 'Pro']['message']\nneutral =df_all[df_all['sentiment'] == 'Neutral']['message']\nanti = df_all[df_all['sentiment'] == 'Anti']['message']\n\n\nnews = [word for line in news for word in line.split()]\npro = [word for line in pro for word in line.split()]\nneutral = [word for line in neutral for word in line.split()]\nanti= [word for line in anti for word in line.split()]\n\nnews = WordCloud(\n    background_color='black',\n    max_words=50,\n    max_font_size=100,\n    scale=5,\n    random_state=1,\n    collocations=False,\n    normalize_plurals=False\n).generate(' '.join(news))\n\npro = WordCloud(\n    background_color='black',\n    max_words=50,\n    max_font_size=100,\n    scale=5,\n    random_state=1,\n    collocations=False,\n    normalize_plurals=False\n).generate(' '.join(pro))\n\n\n\nneutral = WordCloud(\n    background_color='black',\n    max_words=50,\n    max_font_size=100,\n    scale=5,\n    random_state=1,\n    collocations=False,\n    normalize_plurals=False\n).generate(' '.join(neutral))\n\n\nanti = WordCloud(\n    background_color='black',\n    max_words=50,\n    max_font_size=100,\n    scale=5,\n    random_state=1,\n    collocations=False,\n    normalize_plurals=False\n).generate(' '.join(anti))\n\n\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize = (20, 12))\nfig.tight_layout(pad = 0)\n\naxs[0, 0].imshow(news)\naxs[0, 0].set_title('Frequent words from news climate tweets', fontsize = 20)\naxs[0, 0].axis('off')\n\naxs[0, 1].imshow(pro)\naxs[0, 1].set_title('Frequent words from pro climate tweets', fontsize = 20)\naxs[0, 1].axis('off')\n\n\naxs[1, 0].imshow(anti)\naxs[1, 0].set_title('Frequent words from anti climate tweets', fontsize = 20)\naxs[1, 0].axis('off')\n\naxs[1, 1].imshow(neutral)\naxs[1, 1].set_title('Frequent words from neutral climate tweets', fontsize = 20)\naxs[1, 1].axis('off')\n\nplt.savefig('joint_cloud.png')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-23T10:58:18.426429Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-23T10:58:18.426931Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-23T10:58:23.374472Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-23T10:58:18.426886Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-23T10:58:23.37345Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"From the above word clouds we can see that the words climate change and global warming are the most frequest words across all sentiments which is to be expected. Outside of those words we see the following:\n\n\n\n_**Frequent tweets under pro climate change:**_\n \n* We see words like believe, combat, fight, real andaction which represent the belief of the pro climate change supporters who belive that climate change is real and that action needs to be taken to stop it. \n* We also saw that people tweeted about the Environmental Protection Agency(EPA)\n* They also like using words like 'know', 'believe', 'think' because they support the belief of man-made climate.\n\n\n\n\n_**Frequent tweets under News climate change:**_\n\n* Scott Morrison the senior minister who went to Sky news and showed how he is in fact a climate change denier and he doesn't do what he says to the public so a lot of people are tweeting about him as he was also discussing how to reposition climate policies.\n* We also see that people tweeted about the Environmental Protection Agency(EPA), possible the news wanted to hear the views from the representives from the EPA and We also see Trump as one of the words probably because he was publicly against climate change.\n* They also like using words like 'News', 'Study', 'scientists', 'Report', 'Energy', 'record'.\n\n\n\n\n_**Frequent tweets under Neutral climate change:**_\n* We also see Trump as one of the words probably because he was publicly against climate change, we also see Leonardo DiCaprio from the documentary Before the flood.\n* They also mention a lot about The Amp which is a committee on Climate Change and they want the society to change the perceptions of climate change,and alert people about trusted sources of information, communication methods relating to decarbonising homes, carbon conscious behaviour.\n* They also like using words like 'stop', 'need', 'care', 'right', 'cause'.\n\n\n\n\n_**Frequent tweets under Anti climate change:**_\n* Mostly like tweeting the word chinese world they saying the world is ran by China and they  believe Chinese control the climate, they always blame someone for it and they believe it is all made so they can mak more money we can see  Barack Obama and Donald Trump being mentioned as they were the presidents of USA.\n* They also blame it all to the scientists and  \n* They also like using words like 'fake', 'money', 'tax', 'chinese world', 'scam', 'hoax'.\n\n\n**Overall insights across all wordclouds**\n\n* The most buzzwords across all sentiments are climate change, global warming and rt (retweet). The frequency of rt ( Retweet ) means that a lot of the same information and/or opinions are being shared and viewed by large audiences. This is true for all 4 classes\n\n* 'Trump' is a frequently occuring word in all 4 classes. This is unsurprising given his controversial view on the topic and also Barack Obama is mentioned as he once said 'Climate Change Greatest Threat to Future Generations' so we can see him being mentioned a lot by the Anti group they probably saying he is the cause of this as this group will find anyone to blame for anything.\n\n* Words like real, believe, think, fight, etc. occur frequently in pro climate change tweets. In contrast, anti climate change tweets contain words such as 'hoax', 'scam', 'tax', 'liberal' and 'fake'. There is a stark difference in tone and use of emotive language in these 2 sets of tweets. From this data we could reason that people who are anti climate change believe that global warming is a 'hoax' and feel negatively towards a taxâ€“based approach to slowing global climate change.\n\n* words like 'science' and 'scientist' occur frequently as well which could imply that people are tweeting about scientific studies that support their views on climate change.\n\n* EPA, the United States Environmental Protection Agency is another climate change 'buzzword' that appears frequently across classes.\n\n* https occurs frequently in pro climate change tweets, implying that many links are being shared around the topic of climate change. These could be links to petitions, websites and/or articles related to climate change. Interesting to note: https only occurs in the top 25 words for the pro climate change class. We seeing more links in the news class as they are sharing articles and sources of information than any other group.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.4.2 Frequent words Analysis for all the sentiments combined\n\nWe created a visualization of the top 15 words being used in the overall tweets using a bar graph.

Trump, a firm anti climate change individual is appearing very significantly, including the terms scientist, made, fake, alarmist which shows either a lot of people not believing that is real on a hunch or because of a lack of scientific evidence to support the claims. There also a lot of words like scam, money, man-made going on indicating one of the reasons they may not really believe climate change or have negative sentiment against it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_**Frequent words under Neutral mentions:**_ In neutrals people are discussing, engaging and asking about the effects on climate change.
